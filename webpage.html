        <img src="iiita.jpeg" alt="IIITA" width="700" height="300">
        <p>Welcome to our Travel Blog. We are travellers writing about our experience in different countries and beyond. We 
            research destinations ourselves and it's part of the fun - visiting the local<br>library, selecting some travel guides,
            finding insta-worthy photos and more.</p>
        <p>Our passion is travel, we just love visiting new places, immersing into local cultures of life around the world
         and discovering the unexpected! Stepping off a plane, we're always in a hurry to <br>get our passports stamped, reclaim  
         luggage and walk out of the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure.</p>

         <h2>Visiting the Jewel at Changi Airport,<br> Singapore</h2>
         <p>The Jewel is a huge shopping mall and entertainment complex<br>located landside at Singapore's Changi airport. There's 
            much more<br>to it than that though as it is home to the world's tallest indoor<br> waterfall that is known as the Rain Vortex. 
            This stunning waterfall<br> is surrounded by lush tropical gardens with terraced seating.</p>
